Description: shelljob
        ========
        
        This provides a clean way to execute subprocesses, either one or
        multiple in parallel, capture their output and monitor progress:
        
        -  Single sub process ``call`` with optional timeout
        -  High level ``FileMonitor`` to execute several processes in parallel
           and store output in a file
        -  Low level ``Group`` execution to execute jobs in parallel and capture
           output
        
        Additional tools for working with the filesystem are also included:
        
        -  ``find`` which offers much of the functionality of the shell find
           utility
        -  ``shelljob.fs.NamedTempFile`` provides a *with* block wrapper for
           temporary named files
        
            NOTE: Only the Python 3 form is now maintained. The Python 2 is
            still included for backwards compatibility but will not likely get
            new features.
        
        Parallel Subprocesses
        =====================
        
        Using the Job system is the quickest approach to just run processes and
        log their output (by default in files named '/tmp/job\_ID.log')
        
        ::
        
            from shelljob import job
        
            jm = job.FileMonitor()
            jm.run([
                [ 'ls', '-alR', '/usr/local' ],
                'my_prog',
                'build output input',
            ])
        
        An array will passed directly to ``subprocess.Popen``, a string is first
        parsed with ``shlex.split``.
        
        The lower level ``Group`` class provides a simple container for more
        manual job management.
        
        ::
        
            from shelljob import proc
        
            g = proc.Group()
            p1 = g.run( [ 'ls', '-al', '/usr/local' ] )
            p2 = g.run( [ 'program', 'arg1', 'arg2' ] )
        
            while g.is_pending():
                lines = g.readlines()
                for proc, line in lines:
                    sys.stdout.write( "{}:{}".format( proc.pid, line ) )
        
        Simple Subprocess calls
        =======================
        
        A simplified ``call`` function allows timeouts on subprocesses and easy
        acces to their output.
        
        ::
        
            from shelljob import proc
        
            # capture the output
            output = proc.call( 'ls /tmp' )
            # this raises a proc.Timeout exception
            proc.call( 'sleep 10', timeout = 0.1 )
        
        Find
        ====
        
        The 'find' funtion is a multi-faceted approach to generating listings of
        files.
        
        ::
        
            from shelljob import fs
        
            files = fs.find( '/usr/local', name_regex = '.*\\.so' )
            print( "\n".join(files) )
        
        Refer to the `API docs <http://pythonhosted.org/shelljob/>`__ for all
        parameters. Just let me know if there is some additional option you
        need.
